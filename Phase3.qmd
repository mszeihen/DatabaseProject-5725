## **Entity Specification (Character Entity)**
The Character entity is at the heart of the Dungeon and Dragons game database. Several Entities make up a full character, its stats, xp and the equipment it can wear. Characters get gear from monsters and bosses, bosses being a subtype of monsters. The Character entity has the following attributes:

**CharacterID:** some definition

**CharacterName:** some name

** add more stats and describe its cardinality**



## **Relationships & Structure Analysis**

  - List all relationships along with their cardinalities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and participation ratios (total vs. partial participation).

### Cardinality Table

| Entity                  | Cardinality       | Description                                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Player and Character    | One to Many(1:N)  | Many characters are played by one character            |


---

### Participation Ratio Table 

| Entity                  | Participation       | Description                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Player and Character    | Total/Manditory (1)  | Many characters are played by one character            |

## **Identify and explain**

      - Strong vs. weak entities

      - Supertypes and subtypes with their distinguishing features.

## **Table & Column Constraints**

    - Define all constraints such as:

        - Primary and foreign keys

        - NOT NULL requirements

        - Unique constraints

        - Referential integrity rules

## **Normalization Goals**

    - Restructure tables and attributes to achieve Third Normal Form (3NF):

    - Eliminate redundancy

    - Ensure dependencies are logical and efficient

    - Avoid update anomalies
