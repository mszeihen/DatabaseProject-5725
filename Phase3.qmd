1. **Entity Specification (Structured English)**

  - Describe one key entity clearly using structured language.

  - Include its attributes, roles, and how it interacts within the system.

2. **Relationships & Structure Analysis**

  - List all relationships along with their cardinalities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and participation ratios (total vs. partial participation).

  - Identify and explain:

      - Strong vs. weak entities

      - Supertypes and subtypes with their distinguishing features.

3. **Table & Column Constraints**

    - Define all constraints such as:

        - Primary and foreign keys

        - NOT NULL requirements

        - Unique constraints

        - Referential integrity rules

4. **Normalization Goals**

    - Restructure tables and attributes to achieve Third Normal Form (3NF):

    - Eliminate redundancy

    - Ensure dependencies are logical and efficient

    - Avoid update anomalies
