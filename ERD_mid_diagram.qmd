# Introduction

For this project we are designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram using Crowâ€™s Foot notation to model a sales and invoicing system. This diagram should includea all relationship cardinalities, highlights strong and weak entities, and define suitable attributes for each one of the entities and then mark which attribute are required or optional. Additionally, primary and foreign keys are identified to in each table within the database schema.

erDiagram
    DIVISION {
        int division_id PK "Required"
        string name "Required"
        int manager_id FK "Required"
    }
    DEPARTMENT {
        int department_id PK "Required"
        string name "Required"
        int division_id FK "Required"
        int manager_id FK "Required"
    }

```
