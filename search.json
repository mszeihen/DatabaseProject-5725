    "text": "This is a group project. A group may have 3 or 4 people. For this project, I would like only one submission per group. Make sure you include all participating group members, otherwise they will not get credit. Group members you can find it through Ed discussion forum. For example, you can go through the Introduce yourself page or create a thread to find group members.\nThe project is meant to bring all the concepts that you learned in this class together. So, you start off by designing the database, then you proceed to mapping and implementing it ‚Äì so you go all the way from designing a database, documenting it, to implementing it in MySQL.\n\nThe project\nDesign and develop a database of your choice that includes at least:\n1. 5-7 regular strong entities.\n2. One strong and weak entities relationship 3. One supertype and subtype relationship\n4. One 1:1, one 1:M, and one M: N relationship.\n5. Other notes:\no Do not emphasize on too many attributes for the entities.\no Three to four attributes for each entity will be enough.\no Make sure to include a primary key for each entity and use foreign key wherever needed.\n\n\nPhases of the projects:\n\nPhase 1\n\n\nIdentify entities, relationships, attributes\nDesign EER diagram\n\n\nPhase 2\n\n\nInclude cardinality for relationships and attributes in EER diagram\n\nDemonstrate at least one example of strong and weak entities\nDemonstrate at least one example of supertype and subtype entities\n\n\nPhase 3\n\n\nWrite the specifications for your database (Structured English). You need to write out the specifications for only one entity.\n\nWrite out ALL the cardinalities and participation ratios (for all relationships), and explain all the strong and weak, supertype and subtype relationships.\nWrite all the column and table constraints.\n\nNormalization: Try to achieve at least 3NF design.\n\n\nPhase 4\n\n\nImplement the EER diagram into MySQL database\nCreate tables according to the mapping. For this part, submit a description of the tables created in the report.\n\nAdd at least five records. Submit a copy of all the records inserted in the report.\n\nWrite and answer some (at least five) ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù queries for your database.\n\nWhen I say reasonable queries ‚Äì I mean 3-4 table joins to use most of the tables or group of tables in your database. You should not have tables that are of no use. For this part, first, write the queries in English ‚Äì that is, telling me what you are finding in the queries. Then, present the query and finally present the output of the query. e. Include the imported diagram using reverse engineering.\n\n\nSubmission guidelines of the projects:\n\nInclude all the group member‚Äôs name at the top in the project.\n\nOrganize the report in four phases.\n\nSubmit one PDF file including all the phases.\n\nGood Luck!!"

    "text": "Introduction\nThis project was developed as part of COP 5725: Database Systems to showcase the complete process of designing and implementing a database, ie, Conceptual design, logical design, and Physical Design. We will develop a high-level viwee of the data and relationships. Translate that into a logicial model suitable for a relational database. Then finally convert the logical model into an actual database using MYSQL.\nThe focus of our team will be to build a relational database tailored to the operations of a Dungeon and Dragons ecology, encompassing areas like Player and Character records, inventory management, locations, and Bosses. We started by identifying relevant entities and their relationships, followed by crafting an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram that included cardinalities, strong and weak entities, and hierarchical structures like supertypes and subtypes. After applying necessary constraints and normalizing the schema to Third Normal Form (3NF), we implemented the database using MySQL, filled it with sample data, and developed advanced queries to derive valuable insights. The project concluded with a reverse-engineered ER diagram to confirm the alignment between the original design and its actual implementation."
